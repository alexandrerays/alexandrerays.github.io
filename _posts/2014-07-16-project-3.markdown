description: For this project, I chose a recorded video of a highway, which several vehicles are passing through it. Later, I cropped this video because the idea was simply to have a smaller video for faster processing. The idea is to process this video and count the number of vehicles that are passing on this road, as well as adding other KPIs related to the video. Finally, we will create an interface from which the user can upload other videos and, in addition, perform some basic configurations such as changing the confidence level and filtering detection by specific classes such as vehicles, people, etc.
