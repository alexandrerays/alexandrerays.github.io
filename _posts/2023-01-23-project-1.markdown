description: The transport sharing system is one of the urban mobility alternatives that has been gaining more and more space in large cities like SÃ£o Paulo. Better known as MaaS (Mobility-as-a-Service) it represents a change from personally owned means of transportation to mobility solutions that are consumed as a service. In the case of bike sharing services, they are made available so that anyone can use it by unlocking it from a cell phone application. In general, the user is allowed to rent the bicycle in one place and leave it in another place or station different from the initial one, according to the need for locomotion, providing greater flexibility for users. In addition, the bicycle sensor network provides a rich amount of data that can be used to study mobility in cities.
